		<h2>Now</h2>
		
		<p>Finally, this semester I am taking CSC 174 (of course), Intro to Film, The Monstrous Feminine, and Intro to Programming to finish off my web design cluster. So far outside of this class I’ve learned about early cinema, read some interesting medieval texts, and realized I absolutely hate Python because it’s just not as fun as html. Outside of school I spend a lot of time with my new puppy that I got over the summer, making digital art, and also work a retail job at Greece Ridge Mall. </p>
