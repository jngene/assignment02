		<h2>Spring 2019</h2>
		
		<p>During my second semester I began taking Intro to Media Studies, History of Body and Sexuality, Intro to Drawing, and… CSC 170!!! CSC 170 became my favorite class, which led me to decide to have a cluster in web design. I had never done HTML, CSS, or anything else featured in the class before, so I was surprised at how fun I found it and how much I enjoyed doing labs and projects. During this semester I was also hired as a tutor for young children at LEAP which has been the best job I’ve ever had, and made me feel like I was already getting some teaching experience.</p>
