		<h1>Fall 2018</h1>
		
		<p>I began my freshmen year here during Fall 2018. I started off taking courses such as Sex and Power, Maximum English, a required writing course, and Introduction to Art History. I really fell in love with learning about art history, therefore I decided to shift my major towards Language, Media, and Communication as opposed to Literature, so that I could take more art history classes. I also applied for about 15 on-campus jobs, got interviewed for most of them, but didnâ€™t get any of them, so I spent fall 2018 very broke.</p>
